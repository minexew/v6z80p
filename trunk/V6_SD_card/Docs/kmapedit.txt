
KMAPEDIT - A keymap editor for FLOS
------------------------------------

A simple tool for creating and editing
FLOS keymap files.

USEGE:

KMAPEDIT [no args]

FLOS supports unqualified, shifted and
ALTed keys. It uses a scancode-to-ASCII
translation table, by default it is that
of the U.K. but the KEYMAP command can
be used to load a keymap for a different
locale.
 
FLOS keymaps are 294 bytes long (can
also be 196 bytes if ALTed keys are
not required). The format is:

$00-$61 : ASCII codes for unshifted
keys - scancodes $00-61
$62-$c3 : ASCII Codes for shifted
keys - scancodes $00-61
$c4-$125: ASCII Codes for ALTed
keys - scancodes $00-$61

Once the util is loaded you can make
a new keymap from scratch or load 
(CTRL+ F11) and edit an existing
keymap from the KEYMAPS folder.

Press a key to select data entry for
that scancode. Once it is highlighted,
press F1 and F2 to adjust the ASCII
code that the key is to generate.

When complete, save the edited keymap
with CTRL+F12.

CTRL+ESC to quit.
