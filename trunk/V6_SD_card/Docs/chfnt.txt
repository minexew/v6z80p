Use: CHFNT filename [xx]

Filename can include a path. If
no path is supplied, the current
dir and VOL0:FONTS/ are checked
for the font file.

FLOS FONT FILE DESCRIPTION:

The original FLOS .fnt files are
$300 bytes long, in raster format:
96 bytes x 8 lines, covering the
definitions for ASCII characters
32-127 only.

The newer .fff files can be any
size up to 2048 bytes (256
characters), in linear 8-bytes
per-character groups.

When an .fff file is specified
the ASCII code of the first
character to be overwritten can
be specified by adding a hex
code to the command string.

EG:

CHFNT mychars.fff 80

will begin the write at ASCII
character 128.
