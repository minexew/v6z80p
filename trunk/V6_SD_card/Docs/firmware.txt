
FIRMWARE.EXE - Writes data to the
onboard EEPROM in 64KB chunks from
a file in the current dir.

Use: FIRMWARE file.bin [start_block]

Note: "blocks" is 64KB in size,
whereas "slots" are 128KB. Therefore
to use this app to write to EEPROM
slot 1, you would enter:

FIRMWARE file.bin 2

If "start_block" is not specified 
it'll start writing from EEPROM block
0.

USE WITH CARE!
---------------

In almost all cases, you should use
EEPROM.EXE in preference to this
app as EEPROM.EXE is safer and more
elegant. However, unlike EEPROM.EXE
this app should work on all older
versions of FLOS and OSCA so it is
provided as a backup method of
updating the system.
