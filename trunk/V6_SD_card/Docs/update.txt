UPDATE.EXE
----------

Normally 'EEPROM' should be used to
update the data on the V6Z80P's
EEPROM but if the system is quite
old the EEPROM util may not run.

If there any such problems, this
program can be used to update
OSCA, the Bootcode and the version
of FLOS (stored on the EEPROM) in
one go.

This is a single file util that
contains all the necessary data
for all versions of the V6Z80P.
It can be loaded from SD card
or sent to the V6Z80P via serial
link. To run it via serial link
enter the FLOS command:

RX * 5000

Wait for the file to transfer
(it will take a while). Then
enter:


G 5000

And follow the instructions on
screen.

After the program has completed
its work, you should update the
version of FLOS on your SD Card
and use the latest SD card apps
etc from the latest version of
the project archive. See:

wiki.retroleum.co.uk

In future you can use the 'EEPROM'
util to update the system.


Notes:

* Only the PRIMARY bootcode is
updated by this util. You should
use EEPROM to update the backup
bootcode afterwards.

* Only Slot 1 is updated with the
latest version of OSCA. This will
be the PAL version, so if you need
the NTSC version active - you'll
want to use EEPROM to place it in
another slot and set the power-on
boot slot.

* The boot slot will be set to
SLOT 1.
