
CALC.EXE - A simple calculator

Usage: CALC expression

The result is shown in hex, decimal
and binary with leading zeroes
supressed.
                                       
"expression" can contain the following
operators:

 +  Add
 -  Subtract
 *  Multiply
 /  Divide
 &  Logical AND
 |  Logical OR
 >> Shift right
 << Shift left

Numbers are interpreted as hex by
default (or when "$" prefix is used)
Other number base symbols are:

 # Decimal
 % Binary
 "Between quotes" - ASCII value

Brackets can be used - parsing will
be in a simple left to right fashion.

Limitations: 

Only integers can be used.

Internal registers are 16 bit so any
time a value exceeds 65535 an
overflow error will occur.

Underflows are allowed to occur
if the result is no smaller than
-32767
