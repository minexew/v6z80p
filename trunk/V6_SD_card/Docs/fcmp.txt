
FCMP.FLX - Compares two files

Use: FCMP [#] file1 file2

Notes:

If # is included, the operation is
performed without output to the
display (only "ERR" is set).

If the files are not the same size
the comparison runs to the end of
the shortest file.

If any bytes are different, the
"ERR" envar is set to $80.

If the filesizes are different but
the bytes up to the length of the
shortest are the same, "ERR" is
set to $81.
