
CMP.EXE - Compares two areas of memory

Use: CMP [#] Start End Target [Bank]

Notes:

Sets the "ERR" envar to $80 if the 
memory ranges are not the same.

If # is included the command is run
without any output to the display
(only "ERR" is set).

The source bank is always the currently
selected FLOS bank. The target bank is
the same as the source unless specified.
