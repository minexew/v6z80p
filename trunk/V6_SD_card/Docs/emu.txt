
EMU.EXE - Emulator Launcher v0.16
---------------------------------

Used to start Alessandro's cycle
perfect Spectrum emulators.

Use: EMU (options)

If supplied, Options can be:

"M0" (IE: Machine 0 Spectrum 48)
"M1" (IE: Machine 1 Spectrum 128)
"M2" (IE: Machine 2 Pentagon 128)

(When a machine selection argument
is supplied, menu option 1 is used)

Notes:

If the file emu.cfg does not exist
in VOL0:/settings (EG: because
EMU has not been run before) then
the program will scan the EEPROM and
suggest a config slot. If no likely
candidate can be found or you wish
to choose a different slot, the Slot
contents will be listed.

EMU.CFG is a text file containing the
slots used and default emulator.

Emulators can use the status of
the expansion pin EXT_B to determine
hardware configuration options of
the emulated machine (EG: The
Spectrum 48/128 emulators enable
virtual hardware expansion devices
(such divIDE etc) if EXT_B has a
jumper on it. 

For the Spectrum 48/128 emulators:

If this pin is low (pulled down by a
fitted jumper) the only startup
option is: Boot into ESXDOS. If
the pin is high (no jumper) the
you can start in BASIC with the
standard ROM (optionally loading
a .TAP file into memory beforehand) 

For this automatic feature to work

a) OSCA v671+ must be installed and

b) the Spectrum emulator configs must
be versions 048K2715.bin/128K2715.bin
or above.
