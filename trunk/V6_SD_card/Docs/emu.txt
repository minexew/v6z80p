
EMU.FLX - Emulator Launcher v0.14
---------------------------------

Used to start Alessandro's cycle
perfect Spectrum emulators.

Use: EMU (options)

If supplied, Options can be:

"M0" (IE: Machine 0 Spectrum 48)
"M1" (IE: Machine 1 Spectrum 128)
"M2" (IE: Machine 2 Pentagon 128)

(When a machine selection argument
is supplied, menu option 1 is used)

Notes:

If the program has not been run
before you will be prompted to set
the config slot for each emulator
that is to be used.

The settings (slots used, currently
selected emulator) are saved in a
file called emu.cfg in a root folder
named SETTINGS (both are created if
necessary).

Emulators can use the status of
the expansion pin EXT_B to determine
hardware configuration options of
the emulated machine (EG: The
Spectrum 48/128 emulators enable
virtual hardware expansion devices
(such divIDE etc) if EXT_B has a
jumper on it. 

For the Spectrum 48/128 emulators:

If this pin is low (pulled down by a
fitted jumper) the only startup
option is: Boot into ESXDOS. If
the pin is high (no jumper) the
you can start in BASIC with the
standard ROM (optionally loading
a .TAP file into memory beforehand) 

For this automatic feature to work

a) OSCA v671+ must be installed and

b) the Spectrum emulator configs must
be versions 048K2715.bin/128K2715.bin
or above.
