Please note: 

Some of the older demos were made before VGA / 60Hz
output was added to OSCA and so the display will not
be correct and/or music will run too fast.

When using VGA, this can be remedied somewhat by
entering the command VGA50 before running the demos
(but this is a non-standard mode, so all monitors may
not support it).
