V6Z80P Speccy core 2.0.0 README
===============================
This is the binary distribution of V6Z80P Speccy core, a ZX Spectrum 48/128K FPGA core for the V6Z80P+ v1.1
or v1.1b board. Version 1.1 or 1.1b of the board are required because:

- The CPU clock must be generated by the FPGA

1. COPYRIGHT
============
V6Z80P Speccy core is released under the "Modified BSD license".
Please, read the COPYRIGHT.txt file provided with the distribution package for further details.

2. CORE DESCRIPTION
===================
The core simulates a ZX Spectrum 48/128K equipped with a ULA supporting the "ULA+ 64 color mode",
a tape player and a Kempston joystick interface. The CPU clock frequence can be changed on-the-fly
to 3.5MHz, 7MHz. A ZXMMC interface (by Alessandro Poppi) is also emulated; this enables the ResiDOS
(by Garry Lancaster) installation and use.
The AY-3-8912 sound chip is emulated for both the 48K and 128K Spectrum; the core generates a
stereo sound output following the ABC standard (western europe standard).

The core does support VGA output and TV output (PAL or NTSC).

To use VGA output, please close the VGA mode jumper (exactly as you do for FLOS in VGA mode).
The core starts in 50Hz vertical refresh mode; pressing F12 you can switch between 50Hz (PAL emulation)
and 60Hz (NTSC emulation).

To use TV output, please use the VGA to SCART RGB cable supplied with the board.
The core starts in PAL mode, but by pressing F12 you can switch between PAL and NTSC mode.

3. SETUP
========

FPGA Configuration Files
------------------------
To install the core, you should copy the ".bin" files contained in the "configuration" directory
to the root directory of the SD card. Start FLOS, then start the EEPROM TOOL typing "EEPROM + <Enter>"
at the prompt. Identify 2 free slots, then type "1"; when asked, enter the number of the first free slot.
When the file selector appears, select the 48K ".bin" config file you have previously copied on the SD card.
Repeat the EEPROM flash with the 128K ".bin" config file.

EMU.EXE
-------
From version 2.0.0, the core should be started using a FLOS program developed by Phil Ruston called EMU.EXE.
EMU.EXE enables the user to start both 48K and 128K versions of the Speccy core in a simple way.
This program can be copied in any SD Card directory; if you copy it inside the /UTILS directory, it will
be available together all the other "utility" FLOS commands.

ZX Spectrum ROMs
----------------
The ZXSPEC48.ROM abd ZXSPE128.ROM files, available in the "support files" distribution directory, should be copied in the
/SPECTRUM directory of the SD Card; in most cases the files should be already there, as they're also used by
the ZX Spectrum emulator made by Phil Ruston.

TAP files
---------
The .TAP files can be stored in any directory on the multimedia memory (TZX files are not supported at present).
Those files will be selected using the GOSPEC.EXE program at the core startup.

Joystick
--------
You also can attach a joystick to the V6Z80P joystick port "A"; this joystick will be seen as
a Kempston joystick.

Keyboard
--------
A PS/2 keyboard must be, of course, connected to the board.

3.1 ResiDOS
-----------
A standard installation of ResiDOS (with pre-installed TapeIO and TaskMan packages) can be initialised
during the core startup using the GOSPEC.EXE command. To take advantage of this feature, you should copy
the RESI48K.NVR and RESI128K.NVR files, contained in the "support files" distribution directory,
in the /SPECTRUM directory of the SD Card.

4. USAGE
========
Start FLOS.

4.1 EMU.EXE
-----------
Thanks to Phil Ruston, from version 2.0.0 the emulator can be started running the EMU.EXE from command line.

Option 4 - Choose the Spectrum emulator version (48K or 128K)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Pressing the '4' key you can switch between the 2 version of the emulator.

Option 5 - Set Spectrum emulator config slots
---------------------------------------------
First of all, you must tell EMU the number of the EEPROM slots where the config files are stored; to
do this, choose the option 5 and then specify the correct slot numbers for both the 48K and 128K version.

Option 1 - Boot the machine to BASIC
------------------------------------
Selecting this option, the emulator will be started in standard ZX Spectrum 48/128K mode; no tapes, no ResiDOS installed.
The version of the Speccy depends on the machine type selected using the Option 4.

Option 2 - Load .tap /.bin file & boot
--------------------------------------
Selecting this option, a file selector will allow you to choose a TAP file that will be available to the tape player
after the ZX Spectrum boot. Alternatively you can choose a ZX Spectrum binary file that will be executed just after the
core start (this option can be useful to test small Speccy machine code programs...)

Option 3 - Boot into Residos
----------------------------
Selecting this option, if in the SD Card SPECTRUM directory is present a Residos NVR file, this will be automatically restored.

Option 6 - Set machine selection as default
-------------------------------------------
Selecting this option, the machine type currently choosen with option 4 will be set as default at EMU startup.

- Keyboard
----------
The keyboard now behaves like that of normal Spectrum. For reference, you will find (in the
binary core distribution root directory) a JPG image ("spectrum_keyboard.jpg") of a real ZX
Spectrum 48K "rubby" keyboard. All the original keys are mapped to the corresponding PS/2 key;
"CAPS SHIFT" is mapped on the PS/2 "LEFT SHIFT", "SYMBOL SHIFT" is mapped on "RIGHT SHIFT".

Some PS/2 keys are mapped to ZX Spectrum keys combo; the handled combo are:

- Backspace -> CAPS + 0
- Cursors -> CAPS + 5,6,7,8
- "," -> CAPS + n
- "." -> CAPS + m

- Scanline effect
-----------------
When the core starts in VGA mode, the "scanline" effect is enabled by default; this effect
mimics the "stripes" you see on a TV screen. If you don't like this effect, you can enable/disable
it with the key "F11".

- Tape player
-------------
Assuming you copied a "TAP" file into memory, you can load it with the following steps:

- Type the command LOAD "" (to do this you must press the following keys: "J", "RIGHT SHIFT + P",
"RIGHT SHIFT + P", "ENTER". - Press the key "TAB".

You will see the familiar loading stripes, and if you rise the volume of the speakers you will
also hear the loading sounds.

The tape player can be stopped/restarted when needed with the key "TAB".

In the case of the 128K Spectrum, the loading process is even simpler, as you can select the
first option in the ZX Spectrum 128K startup menu, and then "TAB".

- Reset
-------
The RESET jumper on the board is handled by the core and, if closed, will reset the ZX Spectrum.
The "ESC" key too will behave as reset key.

- NMI
-----
The "CAPS" key will behave as NMI button; this button, normally resetting
a ZX Spectrum 48K using a standard ROM, is useful to enter the Task Manager in ResiDOS.

- CPU clock speed
-----------------
At the core startup, the CPU clock frequence will be set to 3.5MHz (standard ZX Spectrum 48/128K);
pressing F1 or F2 on the keyboard, you can change the CPU clock frequency:

F1 = 3.5MHz
F2 = 7.0MHz

The tape player will change its speed accordingly to the CPU clock frequence.

F1 = tape speed 1x
F2 = tape speed 2x

In this way, you can load tapes at 2 times the original speed, and 1/2 of the original time.

7MHz mode is "experimental"; if you use it, be prepared to some incompatibility issues
(i.e.: zx spectrum resets, program crashes), in particular when you run demos or similar programs.

5. ULA Plus 64 color mode
=========================
This core supports one of the graphics mode of ULAplus, an enhanced ULA for the ZX Spectrum designed
by Cheveron, Nikki, CSmith and KLP2. It is designed to make it easy to re-colour existing software
with the minimum of effort.

6. ResiDOS
==========
Please: be sure to use an SD card max 2GB in size and formatted with a FAT16 filesystem!

- Quickstart
------------
For a complete overview of the system, please go to the URL:
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/residos/

Just as an example, I will list some useful commands.

%dir - will show the current directory
%cd"<directory>" - will change the current directory
%snapload"<snapshot file.SNA>" - will load&run a "SNA" file
%snapload"<z80snapshot file.Z80>" - will load&run a "Z80" snapshot file

IMPORTANT!: ResiDOS will recognise the snapshot type (SNA or Z80) by the file extension!
Please, use the correct file extension.

- Install new packages
----------------------
If you want to install a package, go into the directory containing the "pkg" file.
Type the following commands at the prompt:

CLEAR 32767
%install"<file.pkg>"

- TAPE I/O package
------------------
This package enables the loading of TAP and TZX (partially supported) files.
To load a TAP file, go into the directory containing the "tap" file.
Type the following commands at the prompt:

%tapein"<tapfile.tap>" - this command attaches the TAP file
%tapelist - optional, this command will list the TAP content
LOAD "" - exactly as you do to normally load a tape

- TASK MANAGER
--------------
Using this package you can store several tasks at the same time, and switch between them instantly
from the task manager screen. To recall the task manager, press the NMI button ("CAPS" key on the
keyboard).

ResiDOS it's a wonderful system and can do a lot more! For further details, please go to the URL:
