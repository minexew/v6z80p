V6Z80P+ v1.1b - Laser cut acrylic case
--------------------------------------

Prototype by John Barker - early 2013 (autocad)

Notes:
------

*V2 is latest work-in-progress drawing 

All the measurements have been taken off the V6+1.1b board.

The "6mm" refers to the distance between the base plate and the PCB (ie spacer sizes)

The material is 3mm acrylic.

The clip mechanism works well but I need to have another look at the design.
This is what's breaking if too much force is placed upon it.

The mods include sizing of some of the holes I made them too big at 18mm, should be 4mm
(audio, mouse and keyb I think!) I must have miscalculated when I was drawing it up.
The pcb positions are slightly out. The clip needs a slight re-design bigger protrusion
to hold it better.
