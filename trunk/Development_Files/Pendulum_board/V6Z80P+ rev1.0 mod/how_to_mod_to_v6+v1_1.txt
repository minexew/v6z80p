How to mod a V6+V1.0 PCB to V6+v1.1 - Pendulum version.
-------------------------------------------------------

When using the Pendulum daughterboard, a 14MHz clock generator is
no longer required for the Spectrum emulators - this simplifies
the usual V6+v1.0-to-v6+v1.1 modification somewhat. (Naturally
you cannot use the older Spectrum emulators that require the
14MHz clock input - you have to use the Pendulum versions).

First, make sure your system is fully updated and working.

1. Install the V6Z80P+v1.1 config .bin file from this
folder to one of the first seven slots using the FLOS
command EEPROM. If you don't do this the system cannot
start after the mod (unless you have access to a JTAG 
cable). It is recommended that you can make this slot
the active slot before powering off the unmodded board
but you can use the emergency slot selection procedure
to set the boot slot once the board is modded if desired.

2. The neatest way to way to mod the board is to lift
the leg "pin 13" of the 74HCT08 chip (making sure the pad
below is not damaged), then link the lifted leg to pin 14

Otherwise, you need to cut two tracks, remove some resistors
(if present) and link two pairs of points. See the
diagram in this folder for details.

3. If you set the boot slot to the V6z80p+1.1 config file
beforehand, you're all done - power up and you'll essentially
have a V6Z80P+1.1 (Naturally use the v6z80p+v1.1 config
files in future).

If you need to use the manual slot selection:

 * With the power off, install jumper J2 only

 * Power on (LED flashes rapidly).

 * Remove jumper J2

   (If the LED continues to flash rapidly, briefly install and remove the jumper again)

 * The LED will flash once, pause about 5 seconds, then flash twice,
   pause 5 seconds, then flash three times and so on - the number of flashes
   represents the slot selection. During the pause following the slot selection
   you require, replace the jumper - the LED will then stay on permanently
   signifying that the slot has been set.

 * Power off and remove Jumper J2.



Tech details about the different clocking systems on the two boards
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On the V6Z80P+1.0, the 16MHz oscillator drives the Z80 and FPGA.
A signal from the FPGA can inhibit the Z80 clock.

On the V6Z80P+v1.1, the 16MHz oscillator drives the FPGA only.
A signal from the FPGA drives the Z80 clock.

On both boards, the clock is 3.3v level and must be converted
to 5v logic level before passing to the Z80 (a 74HCT08 AND gate is
used for this purpose).
