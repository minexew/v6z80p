
Installing an FPGA config onto the EEPROM
-----------------------------------------


1. Optional: Copy the relevant FPGA config *.bin file to the SD card.

2. Boot into FLOS.

3. Load the EEPROM tool (eeprom.exe)

    If EEPROM.EXE is not on your SD card:
    Enter RX * 5000
    Send EEPROM.EXE from the utils folder with the PC serial link app
    Enter G 5000

4. Choose Option 1 "Write config to slot".

5. Choose an inactive slot.

6. Send the FPGA configuration .BIN file with the Serial Link app
   (or enter filename to load from disk if it has been saved there)

7. Wait for file to download, write to EEPROM and complete verification.

8. Choose Option 2 - "Reconfigure from a slot now" (Non-permanent)

9. When prompted, choose to reconfigure from whichever slot you
   used in step 5

10. The FPGA restarts with the new FPGA firmware. This selection
    persists until power off (or changed again with this util)

   If everything is OK, you can reload the EEPROM tool and choose option 3
   to make the new slot active.


   If you want, you can just rewrite the active slot in the first place, but
   the method above allows you to test the new config before making it default.
   IE: If you overwrite the current Active Slot with a bad config, the FPGA will
   not start at power on and you'll be forced to use one of the emergency options
   to sort it out.
