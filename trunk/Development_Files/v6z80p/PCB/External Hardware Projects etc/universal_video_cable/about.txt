
This is simply a video cable adapter (8 pin mini-DIN to 15 pin D socket)
that automatically operates the V6Z80P's VGA/TV mode select pin depending
on what display is attached.

It achieves this by sensing the select line, if it is not terminated by
a 75 Ohm load, the video select pin is pulled to ground via a transistor
(the jumper pin is normally pulled up)
