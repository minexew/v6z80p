Installing the new bootcode to the EEPROM
-----------------------------------------

Newer versions of the program "EEPROM.EXE" may not work on your current
version of FLOS so I have supplied the original release in this archive.
You can copy the contents of this folder to your SD card or just use the
serial download tool to send the files.


1. Load EEPROM.EXE

2. Choose option 4 - Insert data into EEPROM page

3. Choose block 0

4. Wait for read to finish, enter "F000" as the address within the block

5. Choose [D]ownload or [L]oad file from disk

6. Enter filename as "bootcode.epr" (if loading from disk, or download
   that file with the serial link app now)

7. Wait for write / verify to end.

8. At main menu again, repeat option the steps 2 - 7 but this time
   at step 3, choose block 1 (address f000 at step 4 as before)


Notes:

This new bootcode does now overwrite the old bootcode, therefore old versions
of OSCA will still work.

The new bootcode allows the OS to load as a normal file from the root dir of
SD the card. The OS must have the special header attached (and end in .OSF)

The old command "INSTALL.EXE" is no longer required - you just replace
the .OSF file to update FLOS. The OS can still be installed on the EEPROM,
the latest version of EPROM.EXE has an option specifically to do that).
