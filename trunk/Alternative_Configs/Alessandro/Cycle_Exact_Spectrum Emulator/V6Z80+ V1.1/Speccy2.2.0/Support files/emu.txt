
EMU.EXE - Emulator config launcher

Used to start Alessandro's cycle perfect
Spectrum emulators. (A simple "BOOT n"
is not sufficient as files such as the
Spectrum ROM need to be pre-loaded into
the V6Z80P's memory).

Use: EMU (options)

If supplied, Options can be:

"M0" (IE: Machine 0 Spectrum 48)
"M1" (IE: Machine 1 Spectrum 128)
"M2" (IE: Machine 2 Pentagon 128)

When arguments are supplied, the
emulator boots into Residos or
Esxdos depending on jumper status
of expansion pin B. If the program
has not been run before, you will
be prompted to set the config
slots.

Notes:

The settings (slots used, currently
selected emulator) are saved in a
file called emu.cfg in a root folder
named SETTINGS (both are created if
necessary).

EMU.EXE detects status of expansion
pin EXT_B. If this is low (pulled down
by a jumper) Option 3 will restore
from ESXDOS.NVR If the pin is high
(no jumper)  RESIDOS.NVR is used.
For this automatic feature to work
a) OSCA v673+ must be installed and
b) FLOS v608+ must be installed and
c) the Spectrum emulator configs must
be versions 048K2715.bin/128K2715.bin/
PNTG2A1C.bin or above.
