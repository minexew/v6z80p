IMPORTANT!
----------

Please make sure you use files from the correct folder as the
FPGA config files are not compatible between PCBs. There are 3
main revisions of the V6Z80P:

* The original V6Z80P PCB was made prior to August 2010 and marked
  "V6Z80P Rev 1.1"  (it has an 8 pin mini DIN socket for video)


* The V6Z80P+ V1.0 PCB was made between August 2010 and Dec 2010, the
  PCB is marked "V6Z80P+ Rev1.0", it has a 15pin standard VGA socket)


* The V6Z80P+ V1.1 was made after Jan 2011 and is marked "V6Z80P+ Rev 1.1"
  (This board allows FPGA control of the CPU clock.)  Make sure the OSC SEL
  switch is in the "DOWN" POSITION.

* The V6Z80P+ 1.1b is marked "v6Z80p+ rev 1.1b" (and most noticably has
  a push-push fully enclosed SD card connector). This uses the same config
  files as the V6Z80P+ v1.1 above.


If developing new V6Z80P configs:

See the PCB_technical_manual in "Documentation/Manuals" for full info on the
differences between board revisions.  Also, in general, set your project's
configuration options to pull all I/O pins not used in your project high.
