IMPORTANT!
----------
 
Files in the "V6Z80P" folder are relevant to the original
V6Z80P PCB (made prior to August 2010, marked "V6Z80P Rev 1.1",
with an 8 pin mini DIN socket for video)

Files in the "V6Z80P_plus" folder are relevant to the V6Z80P+ 
PCB (made after August 2010, PCB marked "V6Z80P+ Rev1.0", with
a 15pin standard VGA socket)

Please make sure you use files from the correct folder as the
FPGA config files are not compatible between PCBs.



If developing new V6Z80P configs:

Take note of the pin connections of the peripherals/components on the
PCB (see pin list in docs) and avoid conflicting outputs. In general,
set your project's configuration options to pull all I/O pins not
used in your project high.
