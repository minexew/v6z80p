IMPORTANT!
----------

Please make sure you use files from the correct folder as the
FPGA config files are not compatible between PCBs.

* The original V6Z80P PCB was made prior to August 2010 and marked
  "V6Z80P Rev 1.1"  (it has an 8 pin mini DIN socket for video)

* The V6Z80P+ V1.0 PCB was made between August 2010 and Dec 2010, the
  PCB is marked "V6Z80P+ Rev1.0", it has a 15pin standard VGA socket)

* The V6Z80P+ V1.1 was made after Jan 2011 and is marked "V6Z80P+ Rev 1.1"
  (This board allows FPGA control of the CPU clock.) Normally the OSC SEL
  switch is in the DOWN POSITION but when set UP, the V6Z80P+ v1.1 is compatible
  with the config files for the V6Z80P+ v1.0.


If developing new V6Z80P configs:

Take note of the pin connections of the peripherals/components on the
PCB (see pin list in docs) and avoid conflicting outputs. In general,
set your project's configuration options to pull all I/O pins not
used in your project high.
