Emergency active slot reset mechanism (in newest PIC firmware)
--------------------------------------------------------------

If for whatever reason, the FPGA fails to configure, the active
slot pointer may be pointing to an invalid configuration address
in the EEPROM. Assuming one of the slots contains a valid version
of OSCA, you can recover from this by manually setting the slot
pointer with this procedure:


1. Power off.

2. Install jumper J2 only

3. Power on (yellow led flashes rapidly - JTAG mode).

4. Remove jumper J2 again

5. The PIC will reset the active slot to 1 (indicated by 1 pulse of the red LED)
   The yellow led lights up for 4 seconds then Slot 2 is set (2 flashes of red LED),
   again there's a 4 second pause, finally slot 3 is set (3 flashes).

6. Power off only when the yellow LED is lit following the desired slot setting.


When you power on the active slot will correctly point to slot 1, 2 or 3.
