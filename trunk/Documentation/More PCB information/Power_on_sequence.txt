
Normal power On activity
------------------------

1. Power switched on.

2. Z80 CPU is held reset (by FPGA "done" line)

3. PIC checks JTAG-mode jumper J2 (only)

  * If jumper J2 is installed, the status LED flashes rapidly until the FPGA has 
    been manually configured by downloading a .bit file from Xilinx impact software
    on PC.

  * If jumper J2 is not installed, the PIC sends the config data stored in
    the current active slot of the EEPROM to the FPGA. 

4. If the FPGA starts up correctly with the architecture file supplied (ie: the
   FPGA "Done" line goes high) the status LED stays on. If the config fails, the
   status LED will pulse and the PIC goes back to step 3.

5. The Z80 is released from reset
