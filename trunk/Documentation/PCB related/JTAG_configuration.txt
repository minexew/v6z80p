* Configuring the V6Z80P's Spartan 2 XC2S150 FPGA via JTAG *
************************************************************

------------------------------ WARNING!! ----------------------------------- 

It may be possible to damage the v6Z80P by configuring it with an incompatible
design - upon compilation ensure the pin assignments match those in the
original OSCA design (see the .ucf file) and that the data direction 
of the pins is correct (check the Design Summary / Pad report). In general,
if it doesn't start up once the status LED is steady-on, power down immediately.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


JTAG CABLE CONFIG:
------------------

With the power off put two jumpers on the JTAG CONFIG pin headers J1 and J2
Connect your JTAG cable. Load up Xilinx Webpack. Power up the V6Z80P and the
status LED will flash quickly - this happens until the FPGA config data has
been accepted. (During configuration, the FPGA pins are pulled high and the
Z80 is held in the reset state.)

The programming cable/interface is powered by the V6Z80P - the pin outs
are the Xilinx standard IE:

* 1 - VCCO (Top pin, nearest FPGA chip)                             
* 2 - GND                                                           
* 3 - TCK                                                             
* 4 - TDO                                                             
* 5 - TDI                                                             
* 6 - TMS

To use the Xilinx Impact software to download the new architecture config:
click "Configure target device" and fOllow the prompts. On the first attempt
You may have to set Impact to the type of programming cable you have (I use
a "Parallel 3" type - see schematic in this folder) - the setting is in the
preferences/options section. Impact should see the FPGA and request a config
(*.bit) file. Open it, it will then probably say something like "no specifications
have been set" - ignore this, and right click on the green chip icon and select
"Program". A progress bar appears for a short time (5 seconds?), when complete
the FPGA should start up. (I have noticed on occasion the software thinks the
download has been successful but the status LED continues to flash meaning the
FPGA did not raise its "DONE" line. If this happens, power down the V6Z80P,
close Impact and redo).

(For stability, disconnect the JTAG header when using normal EEPROM config)

Note: If using PIC firmware 637, closing J2 after JTAG configuration will not
reset/reconfigure the V6Z80P.



------------------- Quick Xilinx Webpack Guide ---------------------

1. Install webpack ISE 10.1 (you'll read a registration code from
   Xilinx.com - this is free).

2. Click open project.

3. Browse to v6xx.ise (whatever is the latest design version)
   and open it.

4. In the processes box, click "Generate programming file".

5. Wait a couple of minutes. Ignore all the warnings..

6. Two files "xxxx.bit" (for JTAG) and "xxxx.bin" (for SPI EEPROM)
   are created in the project directory (where xxxx is the project name)


Notes/Issues:
-------------

To create the .bin file required for EEPROM config, you need to right
click the "generate programming file" option, go to properties and tick
the revelent box under "general options"

OSCA uses the "keep hierachy" switch ("soft") - right click
"Synthesize - XST" to access this option. This setting is "off" by
default when you make a new project so should be set manually
if making an OSCA variant.  

Sometimes Webpack fails to complile a valid design. If this happens
it is necessary to make a fresh project and import all the files from
the previous one.. Be sure to check the pin configuration upon
compilation - if you forget the .ucf constaints file (which contains
the pins and ROM data) ISE will NOT tell you - it'll just choose pins
at random!! (If making a new project, choose Spartan 2, XC2S150, PQ208, 5 ns)
