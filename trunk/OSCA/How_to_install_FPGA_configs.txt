IMPORTANT!

Please make sure you use files from the correct folder as the FPGA config
files are not compatible between different versions of the V6Z80P.


Visible differences between boards
----------------------------------

* The original V6Z80P PCB was made prior to August 2010 and marked
  "V6Z80P Rev 1.1" Uniquely, it has an 8 pin mini DIN socket for video.

* The V6Z80P+ V1.0 PCB was made between August 2010 and Dec 2010, the
  PCB is marked "V6Z80P+ Rev1.0". Uniquely, it has a 3 pin serial comms socket.

* The V6Z80P+ V1.1 was made after Jan 2011 and is marked "V6Z80P+ Rev 1.1"
  Uniquely, it has a switch marked "OSC SEL" in the bottom right - Make
  sure this is set to the DOWN POSITION.

* The V6Z80P+ 1.1b is marked "V6Z80P+ V1.1b" - Uniquely, the SD card connector
  is a push-push, enclosed type. This board uses the same config files as the
  V6Z80P+ V1.1



Installing an FPGA config onto the EEPROM
-----------------------------------------

1. [Optional: Copy the relevant FPGA config *.bin file to the SD card.]

2. Boot into FLOS.

3. Load the EEPROM tool (eeprom.exe)

4. Choose Option 1 "Write config to slot".

5. Choose an inactive slot.

6. Locate the config .bin file on disk, or send it (from "Config File" folder)
   with the Serial Link app, choosing the "RS232" option in the dialog box for
   serial download.

7. Wait for file to load, write to EEPROM and complete verification.

8. Choose Option 2 - "Reconfigure from a slot now" (Non-permanent)

9. When prompted, choose to reconfigure from whichever slot you
   used in step 5

10. The FPGA restarts with the new FPGA firmware. This selection
    persists until power off (or changed again with this util)

11. If everything is OK, you can reload the EEPROM tool and choose option 3
    to make the new slot active.

   ( If you want, you can just rewrite the active slot in the first place, but       )
   ( the method above allows you to test the new config before making it the         )
   ( default startup config.  IE: If you accidentally overwrite the current Active   ) 
   ( Slot data with a bad config, the system will not start at power on and you'll   )
   ( be forced to use one of the manual config options to correct it.                )

   ( It is recommended that a known-working OSCA config file is always left in slot 1 )
