
Notes for demos folder:

"Boing", "Spira", "Vectorballs2" and "Wireframe" were designed for
the PAL 50Hz TV spec. They will run at 60Hz (NTSC or VGA), but
there's likely to be glitches and the music will be too fast.

"Parity" and "Pipes" have compensation built in and run fine
in all modes.


20-10-2012:

Most of the include paths need updating therefore the
demos may give errors when assembling.
