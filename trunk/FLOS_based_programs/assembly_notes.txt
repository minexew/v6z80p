To assemble the supplied source code with Pasmo, first add "v6z80pdir" to your
environment variable list.  Under XP: 

In System Properties..advanced..environment variables..system variables..

"New"

Variable name = v6z80pdir

Variable value = [full path to v6z80p folder] 

And reboot PC. Then to assemble .asm files, just drag them to the "assembler.bat" file
in the same directory as the source file. A object code .bin is created in the same
directory.

My source code often does not contain paths for included data as Pasmo's command
line options allow paths to be included automatically with the "-I" switch.

I normally set my source code tab size to 10 characters.
