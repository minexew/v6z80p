
A unix 'wc' implementation: it lacked all those
parameters which permit its extensive use on
the UNIX shells but it's easier and featured
an 'overviev' layout which I adapted to the
limited 40 colums display.

From Wikipedia:

wc (short for word count) is a command in Unix-like operating systems.

The program reads either standard input or a list of files and
generates one or more of the following statistics: newline count, word count, and byte count. If a list of files is
provided, both individual file and total statistics follow.

Sample execution of wc:

wc foo bar

     40     149     947 foo
   2294   16638   97724 bar
   2334   16787   98671 total

The first column is the count of newlines, meaning that the text file foo has 40 newlines while bar has 2294 newlines- resulting in a total of 2334 newlines. The second column indicates the number of words in each text file showing that there are 149 words in foo and 16638 words in bar- giving a total of 16787 words. The last column indicates the number of characters in each text file, meaning that the file foo has 947 characters while bar has 97724 characters- 98671 characters all in all.

Newer versions of wc can differentiate between byte and character count. This difference arises with Unicode which includes multi-byte characters. The desired behaviour is selected with the -c or -m switch.

GNU wc used to be part of the GNU textutils package; it is now part of GNU coreutils.
Usage

    wc -l <filename> print the line count
    wc -c <filename> print the byte count
    wc -m <filename> print the character count
    wc -L <filename> print the length of longest line
    wc -w <filename> print the word count
