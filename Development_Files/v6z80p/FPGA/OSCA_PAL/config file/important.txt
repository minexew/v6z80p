
** Update the bootcode to version 6.12 before installing OSCA version 663 !! **

Reason:

Previous versions of the bootcode contain calls to locations within the
ROM which are no longer valid, so the system will not start up correctly
if old bootcode is present.

The new ROM does provide an "escape route": Connect a joystick to port A
and hold fire, up and right on power up. The screen will go grey allowing
the latest bootcode to be sent via serial link. Once the system starts
you can use EEPROM.EXE to install the latest bootcode to the EEPROM.
