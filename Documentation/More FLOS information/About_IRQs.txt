A note about the ROM interrupt vectors:
---------------------------------------

The OSCA ROM* has the instruction "JP $0A00" at $38 (IRQ) and "JP $0A03" at $66 (NMI).
OSCA is designed to use Interrupt Mode 1. 

FLOS places the following code at these locations:

$0A00: JP aabb (where aabb is FLOS's default IRQ handler)
$0A03: JP ccdd (where ccdd is FLOS's default NMI handler)

See the FLOS manual for more information on how the OS handles interrupts.

The ROM disables normal interrupts (with the Z80 DI instruction) and NMI interrupts 
(via hardware using the "Disable NMI switch input" port bit) and it is up to the user
program to enable the IRQs if interrupts are required.


Notes:
------

It is possible to have read/write access the system RAM "underneath" the ROM/Palette
at $000-$1ff (see the port "sys_alt_write_page"). In all there are three options
for this memory range:

A) Read ROM / Write palette (default)
B) Read system RAM / write palette (set by bit 4 of sys_alt_write_page)
c) Read System RAM / write system RAM (set by bit 6 of sys_alt_write_page)


The IRQ vectors must be set appropriately in system RAM when non-ROM reads are
enabled (and interrupts are required).
