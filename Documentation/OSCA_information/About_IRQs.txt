A note about the ROM interrupt vectors:
---------------------------------------

The OSCA ROM* has the instruction "JP $0A00" at $38 (IRQ) and "JP $0A03" at $66 (NMI).
OSCA is designed to use Interrupt Mode 1. 

FLOS places the following code at these locations:

$0A00: JP aabb (where aabb is FLOS's default IRQ handler)
$0A03: JP ccdd (where ccdd is FLOS's default NMI handler)

See the FLOS manual for more information on how the OS handles interrupts.

The ROM disables normal interrupts (with the Z80 DI instruction) and NMI interrupts 
(via hardware using the "Disable NMI switch input" port bit) and it is up to the user
program to enable the IRQs if interrupts are required.


Notes:
------

From OSCA v656 onwards, it is possible to have read/write access the system RAM
"underneath" the ROM at $000-$1ff (see the port "sys_alt_write_page"). However,
paging in this memory pages out the colour palette so care must be taken if
CPU access to the palette is required thereafter.
