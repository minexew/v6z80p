A note about the ROM interrupt vectors:
---------------------------------------

Locations $38 (IRQ) and $66 (NMI) in the default ROM hold the instructions:

$38: JP irq_jp_inst

$66: JP nmi_jp_inst

(where irq_jp_inst is $A00 and nmi_irq_inst is $A03, as set up in the equates file)

It is up to the user program to place appropriate code at $A00 and $A03, ordinarily
this will be additional jumps to the actual location of the interrupt handler.

EG:

$A00 JP My_IRQ_routine ; C3 XX YY
$A03 JP My_NMI_routine ; C3 XX YY

Note also that at startup the ROM disables normal interrupts (with the DI instruction)
and NMI interrupts (using the "Disable NMI switch input" port bit) and it is up to the
user program to enable the IRQs if interrupts are required.


Notes:
------

From OSCA v656 onwards, it is possible to access the system RAM "underneath"
the ROM at $000-$1ff by paging out the Video palette. Therefore the IRQ
vectors can be directly set if required.


Interrupt mode 0 is not currently supported.
