V6Z80P Joystick interface description
-------------------------------------

Simply uses a PIC microcontroller to read 2 x 6 pin digital inputs
from Atari/Amiga standard* 9 pin D-Sub connectors and sends data
serially to the FPGA using two pins: Clock and Data. FPGA provides
the clock, Data is always PIC -> FPGA.

Data bits are output following detection of a rising edge on READ_CLOCK_IN
The FPGA therefore latches each bit on the following clock high edge.


 ACTION......    Latch 0    Latch 1     
          ____      V_____      V_____
 CLOCK __!    !_____!     !_____!     !____ 
 DATA------<===BIT 0==><==BIT 1===><==BIT2==>


When the clock stays low for more than ~300 microseconds, the data packet send
is aborted, new joystick values are read from the ports and the data transmission
begins on the next clock high.

Transmission is a 16 bit word in the following order:

(Joy A) U,D,L,R,F1,F2, 0,0, (Joy B) U,D,L,R,F1,F2, 0,0
