
How to mod a V6+V1.0 PCB to V6+v1.1:
====================================

First, make sure you have a V6+1.1 config installed in
one of the first seven slots. If you don't, the system
cannot start after the mod (unless you have access
to a JTAG cable). You can make this slot the active
slot before powering off the unmodded board or use
the emergency slot selection procedure to set the boot
slot once the board is modded.

The basic requirement of the V6+1.1 clocking system is:

The output from the onboard 16MHz oscillator goes
direct to FPGA pin 80 (GCLK0) (yellow in the diagrams)

The output from a 14MHz oscillator goes direct to
FPGA pin 77 (GCLK1) (brown in the diagrams)

The output from FPGA pin 75 (cyan in the diagrams) goes to
input [A] of a 74HCT08 AND gate. Input [B] can be connected
to input [A] or pulled high (it is connected to 5v via a 1k
resistor on a real V6+1.1). The output from the AND gate needs
to go direct to the Z80's clock input (pin 1) - this is
coloured red in the diagrams.

(The AND gate may seems pointless, but its function is to
raise the 3.3v logic clock signal to the 5v CMOS level that
the Z80 requires.)


There are many ways to make the modifications, two
ways are shown in the .pngs:

Method 1 is most like a real V6+v1.1 but requires
a bit more work.

Method 2 is simpler but the 16MHz oscillator is
unnecessarily driving 2 AND inputs (instead of 1)
and the FPGA output clock is driving 3 AND inputs
instead of 1. However, it is not anticipated that
this will cause trouble.


Power connections to the additional 14MHz oscillator are
not shown as this depends what is available. The real
v6+1.1 uses a 3.3v level oscillator made from a crystal
and 74hc04 inverter. Note that your oscillator may
require a decoupling capacitor across its supply pins
for stability - see its datasheet.
