Disclaimers:
------------

The V6Z80P is merely a hobbiest's project and not a professional
design. As such it is not intended to be a complete end product,
more of an ongoing project that is supplied at a hopefully
stable point in its development. There may well be bugs,
glitches or other unforeseen issues. 

Most things have been tested quite extensively but no guarantees
as to fitness for any particular purpose are offered. Also it is,
to be connected to the user's equipment entirely at their own risk.

Any future developments should be backwards compatible with
the existing hardware design, but this is not guaranteed.

The V6Z80P PCB design, OSCA FPGA architecture, FLOS operating system
and software supplied remain the copyright of Phil Ruston 2008-2012,
but can be modified if desired and used freely for non-profit,
non-commercial applications.
