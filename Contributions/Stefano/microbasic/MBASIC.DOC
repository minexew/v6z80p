made by Stefano Bodrato, originally written in 8085 assembler, 
now ported to z80 and i486: could you imagine a smaller interpreter ?



Comments for the v6z80p version
-------------------------------

SAVE "PROGRAM" and LOAD "PROGRAM" are supported.
Sources are compatible at binary level with the MS-DOS version ones
so, even if tricky, a source could be pasted to the DOS console, 
checked, saved, and transferred to the OSCA SD-card afterwards.

I couldn't get the original editor code run perfectly, so I saved
few more bytes and relied onto the native FLOS line input routine.

   1. INTRODUCTION
   
         Micro Basic was implemented with the intention  of  providing  the
      maximum amount of features and flexibility, in the minimum amount  of
      memory space. It is intended for use on 8080/8085/Z80 based computers
      which are too small to afford the use of larger programming  systems.
      Currently, the Micro Basic  interpreter,  is  3K  bytes  in  size.  A
      machine-language MONITOR and all hardware dependant I/O routines  are
      also included, bringing the total rom size to 4K. A minimum of 3K  of
      ram is required if any useful programs  are to  be  implemented.  The
      interpreter only makes use of memory as it needs it, and  memory  can
      be expanded at any time, to allow for larger programs or  more  array
      space.  Micro  Basic  is  quite  different  from  most  other   BASIC
      interpreters,  in  particular  the  right  to   left   execution   of
      expressions, with no operator precedence, and  the  use  of  separate
      operators for EQUALS and ASSIGNMENT. These implementation  decisions,
      were in part, based on the language APL, which is a favorite language
      of the author.
   
         The Micro Basic rom, is assembled to  go  at  location  zero,  and
      occupies the range of addresses from 0000-0FFF. The software supports
      a 16 line by 64 character 1K  memory  mapped  video  display,  to  be
      located in the address range from 1000-13FF. The  system  RAM  should
      start at 1400 and may continue on up to FFFF. The keyboard should  be
      on a parallel input port,  located  as  port#0,  with  the  keystrobe
      (active high) on bit#7, and ASCII data is expected on bits  0-6.  The
      keystrobe should remain high for as long as the key  is  pressed. The
      serial I/O for the tape is expected to be an INTEL 8251 with the data
      port mapped as port#1, and the control port as  port#2.  The  receive
      and transmit clocks should be 16x the desired speed.
   
         On the following pages, is a brief description  of  Micro  Basic's
      commands and features.

   2. COMMANDS
   
         Operands to commands are as followes:
   
         <e> - Any expression.
         <v> - Any variable.
         <a> - Any array variable.
         <n> - Any numeric expression.
         <l> - A line number.
         [ ] - Optional operands.
         ... - Multiple extra operands allowed.
   
      2.1 General commands
   
            The following  commands,  may  be  entered  directly  from  the
         keyboard, or executed with a BASIC program.
   
         CLEAR
   
            Clears  all  numeric  and  character  variables,  Delete's  all
         arrays, and resets the control stack and data pointer.
   
         DIM a1(<n1>)[,a2(n2)]...
   
            Dimensions integer arrays a1, a2,... makeing  them  n1,  n2,...
         elements each. Arrays may be REDIMENSIONED with the DIM statement,
         however this allocates new memory for the array, causing  the  old
         memory used by the old array to be  made  unusable  (until  'NEW',
         'CLEAR' or a 'RUN'  command  is  issued).  Whenever  an  array  is
         dimensioned or redimensioned via DIM, it is cleared to zeros.
   
         NOTE: Array space is allocated in memory, starting at the  end  of
               the program source. As a result, if a line is inserted  into
               the program, or any line is replaced  in  the  program,  any
               existing arrays will be deleted.
   
         END
   
            Stops the program. no messages are issued.
   
         EXIT
   
            Exits to the system monitor.
   
         GOTO <line#>
   
            Transfers program execution to the statement at  the  beginning
         of line <line#>.
   
         GOTO(<n>),<l1>[,<l2>]...
   
            Transfers program execution to the statement at  the  beginning
         of line <l1> if <n>=0, to the beginning of  line  <l2>  if  <n>=1,
         etc. results in SYNTAX ERROR if <n> is greater than number of line
         numbers given.
   MICRO BASIC USERS GUIDE                                          Page: 3


         INPUT <v>
   
            Requests a value for <v> from  the  terminal.  Prompts  with  a
         question mark "?". If <v> is a character variable, then  any  text
         can be input. If <v> is numeric, then value  supplied  must  be  a
         number or expression.
   
         INPUT "<text>",<v>
   
            Same as above, but prompts with <text> instead of  "?".  <text>
         can be a null string ( INPUT "",<v> would give no prompt ).
   
         NOTE: The value of a character variable can be used in the prompt,
               but must be concatinated with <text>. EG: ' INPUT ""+A$,V '.
   
         LET <v>=<e> (default)
   
            Assigns the value of <e> to the variable <v>. If any lines  are
         found by the interpreter which do not contain a command, then they
         are assumed to be LET.
   
         LIST [<l1>][,<l2>]
   
            Lists the program,if no operands  are  given,  then  lists  the
         entire program. If <l1> is given then only that line is listed. If
         <l2> is also given, then lists from <l1> to <l2> inclusive.
   
         LOAD
   
            Loads  a  program  from  tape.  Flashes  a  '*'  in  the  upper
         right-hand corner of the screen for every record (255 Bytes)  that
         is loaded.
   
         NEW
   
            Clears the program, variables, and arrays.
   
         ORDER <line#>
   
            Positions the read pointer to the start of  the  line  <line#>.
         This line must begin with a DATA statement, or a  DATA ERROR  will
         occur.
   
         PRINT <e>[,<e>][,<e>]...[,]
   
            Prints the expressions on the terminal. Numeric values will  be
         printed with  a  preceding  space.  If  a  numeric  expression  is
         preceded by a single '(', then the preceding space is not printed.
         ( EG: PRINT 12,(12 would  display  '  1212'  ).  If  the  list  of
         expressions ends with a trailing comma, then no line-feed carriage
         return will be  printed,  causing  the  next  PRINT  statement  to
         continue at the end of the same line.
   MICRO BASIC USERS GUIDE                                          Page: 4


         PLOT <x>,<y>[,<e>][,<e>]...[,]
   
            Same as PRINT, except cursor is positioned at column <x>,  line
         <y> (from the top lefthand corner of the screen), before the  rest
         of  the  operands  are  printed.  'PLOT  <x>,<y>'  with  no  other
         operands, will position the cursor with no output.
   
         READ <v>[,<v>]...
   
            Reads the values for variables from data statements.  An  ORDER
         statement must be done before the first read  in  a  program,  and
         anytime that you have read all the data in a data  block.  A  data
         block, is a  collection  of  data  statements  which  are  located
         separately, with no other  statements  between  them.  If  a  read
         statement does not read all of the data in a given data statement,
         then the next read will pick up where the last one left off. If  a
         read statement reads beyond the end of a data  statement,  the  it
         will advance to the next statement and attempt to read from there.
   
         REM <text>
   
            Comment, the rest of the statement is ignored.
   
         RUN
   
            Clears variables and arrays, then starts the program running. A
         running program can be stopped by pressing CONTROL-C.
   
         SAVE
   
            Saves a program on tape.
   
         SIZE
   
            Prints the size of the program in bytes.
   
         STOP
   
            Stops the program, issues message indicating line number  where
         it was executing.
   
         USR <n1>[,<n2>][,<v>]
   
            Calls a user supplied machine code routine at address <n1>.  If
         <n2> is given, its value will be passed in the H-L register  pair.
         If <v> is given, it must  be  a  numeric  variable,  and  will  be
         assigned the value of  H-L  after  the  machine  language  routine
         returns.

      2.2 Program only commands
   
            The following commands, can only be executed within a program.
   
         DATA <e>[,<e>]...
   
            Defines program DATA, to be read by the  READ  statement,  into
         program  variables.  DATA  statements  are  not  executed  by  the
         interpreter.
   
         NOTE: Variables can be used in the DATA statements,  but the value
               will be evaluated as the value of that variable at the  time
               that the DATA statement is read.
   
         FOR <v>=<n1> TO <n2>
   
            Starts a program loop. The variable <v> will be set to <n1>.and
         will be incremented by one every time around the  loop.  until  it
         value is equal to <n2>. <v> must be a simple numeric variable. See
         also 'NEXT' statement.
   
         GOSUB <line#>
   
            Calls a  BASIC  subroutine  at  given  line  number.  (Same  as
         goto,but stacks return address.) See also 'RETURN' statement.
   
         GOSUB(<n>),<l1>,<l2>...
   
            Same  as  above,  but  uses  computed  line  number.  See  also
         'GOTO(<n>)'.
   
         IF <e> THEN <stmt>
   
            Evaluates  <e>,  If  it  is  true  (non-zero)  then  <stmt>  is
         executed. If <stmt> is a number, then assumes GOTO <stmt>.
   
         LIF <e> THEN <stmts>
   
            Long IF, same as IF, except that the entire  remainder  of  the
         line is executed only if the expression <e> is true.
   
         NEXT <v>
   
            Closes a program loop. <v> must match the <v> in  the  matching
         'FOR' statement.
   
         RETURN
   
            Returns to statement following GOSUB statement.  (Terminates  a
         BASIC subroutine)

   3. EXPRESSIONS
   
         Expressions can be either numeric or character.  all  expressions,
      are evaluated from right to left, with NO operator precedence (as  in
      the language APL). For example, 1+5*5 evaluates to 26, but 5*5+1 will
      give the answer 30. Precedence can be forced in  numeric  expressions
      with the use of brackets "()". Brackets can be nested to any depth.
   
      3.1 Numeric operators
   
            FORMAT: "X<operator>Y"
   
           +   Addition. 
   
           -   Subtraction.
   
           *   Multiplication.
   
           %   Division. (Remainder assigned to special variable "R").
   
           &   Bitwise logical AND of X and Y.
   
           |   Bitwise logical OR of X and Y.
   
           \   Floor. (returns lesser of X and Y).
   
           /   Ceiling. (returns greater of X and Y).
   
           =   Assignment. (X takes value of Y).
   
           ==  Equality. (returns 1 if X equals Y, 0 otherwise).
   
           >   Greater than. (returns 1 if X greater than Y, 0 otherwise).
   
           <   Less than. (returns 1 if X less than Y, 0 otherwise).
   
           >=  Greater equals. (Returns 1 if X GE Y, 0 otherwise).
   
           <=  Less equals. (Returns 1 if X LE Y, 0 otherwise).
   
           -=  Not equals. (Returns 1 if X not equal to Y, 0 otherwise).
   
           ;   Null operator, returns value of X. (but executes Y).
               Especially useful for doing modular arithmetic.
               The expression "A=R;B%123" will divide B by 123 (without
               changing B), and then assign the remainder to A. (Right
               to left execution).
   MICRO BASIC USERS GUIDE                                          Page: 7


   3.2 Character operators
   
       FORMAT: "X$<operator>Y$"
   
           +   Concatonation. (Y$ appended to X$).
   
           =   Assignment. (X$ takes value of Y$).
   
           ==  Equality. (only valid in "IF" and Numeric conversion).
   
           -=  Not equals. (only valid in "IF" and numeric converson)
   
   The following are other operators which perform useful functions:
   
           ( ) Brackets, Force operator precedence.
   
           [ ] Braces, Used to index numeric arrays, E.G. "A[10]"
               Also can be used to extract a single character
               from a character variable. E.G. "A[0]$" returns
               the first character in variable "A$".
               (Index starts at zero (0) ).
   
           #   Hexidecimal constants. EG. "A=FF#+1" calculates "FF#"
               as 255, adds 1 then assigns result (256) to "A".
   
           :   Statement separator, can be used to place multiple
               statements on a single program line: E.G: "A=10:PRINT A"
   
           ,   Operand separator, separates operands to some commands.
   
      3.3 Numeric conversion
   
            A character expression can be included in a numeric expression,
         but must be contained in brackets "()". If the  leftmost  operator
         in the character expression is one of "==" or "-=", then a 1 or  0
         is returned to the numeric (outside) expression. If  the  leftmost
         operator  of  the  character  expression  is  "=",then  the  value
         returned is the ASCII value of the  first  character  of  the  OLD
         value of the character variable. Otherwise the ASCII value of  the
         first character in the  result  of  the  character  expression  is
         returned. The ASCII value of a character, is the decimal value  of
         it's binary representation. (E.G. " " (blank) is 32).  If  a  null
         string ("") is the result of the expression,then the value 255  is
         returned (ASCII values for characters can only  range  from  0  to
         127). The expression within the brackets does not have to  contain
         operators, I.E. " PRINT ("A") " will  print  a  65.  (The  decimal
         value of an ASCII "A").

      3.4 Variables
   
            There are 26 simple integer variables  (A-Z).  These  variables
         always exist and are cleared to zero when BASIC is entered, when a
         NEW command is executed, and when a program is RUN.  Integers  are
         positive, with a range of 0 to 65535 (16 bits of data).
   
            There are also up to 26 integer arrays, (A[n] - Z[n]). An array
         must be created (via the 'DIM' command) before it  exists.  Arrays
         are cleared to zero's when they are created.
   
            Arrays  when  dimensioned,  (DIM  A(n))  have   n+1   elements,
         subscripts ranging form 0 to n. Subscripts are not checked by  the
         interpreter, therefore, if you type 'DIM A(10),B(10)'  then  A[11]
         is the same as B[0].
   
            There are 26  character  variables,  (A$-Z$).  These  variables
         always exist and are cleared to null strings ("")  when  BASIC  is
         entered, when a NEW is executed,and when a program  is  RUN.  Each
         character variable can hold up to 35  characters.  The  individual
         characters can be read using braces between the character variable
         name, and the dollar sign. (ie. A[0]$ to A[34]$). If an  index  is
         greater than 34, a DIMENSION ERROR will result.  If  an  index  is
         greater than the number of characters currently in  the  variable,
         but less than 35, then  a  null  string  ("")  will  be  returned.
         Character variables cannot be assigned values in this manner.
   
            The variable names are all separate, you can have A,  A[n]  and
         A$, all in the same program, without interaction between them.

      3.5 Special variables
   
            The simple integer variable 'R' is a special  variable  because
         it will be assigned the remainder whenever a divide  operation  is
         executed.
   
            The following are special variables, unlike 'R', they cannot be
         used as 'normal' variables:
   
          @[n] This variable can only be referenced as an array. When read,
               it returns the BYTE value (0-255) of the memory  location at
               its index (n). When assigned a value,  that  value  will  be
               assigned to the memory location at its index  (n).  (if  the
               value assigned is > 255 Then it is divided by 256,  and  the
               remainder is used). This is the Same function as 'PEEK'  and
               'POKE' in some other BASIC's.
   
         @[n]$ This character variable, can  only  be  referenced  with  an
               index. Its index can range from 0 to 255. It will return the
               character which has the binary value of its index.  (if  255
               is used, it will return a null  string.  This  is  the  same
               function as 'CHR$' in some other basics.
   
             ? This variable can only be referenced  as  a  simple  integer
               variable When read, it returns a random  number  from  0  to
               65535. When given a value, it sets the random seed  to  that
               value. Random numbers can be generated within limits by  the
               use of modular arithmetic. (EG. to generate a random  number
               between 0 and 99, and assign it to the variable 'A', use the
               command 'A=R;?%100').This is similar to the  'RND'  function
               of some other basics.

   4. PROGRAM ENTRY AND EDITING
   
         To enter or replace a line, simply enter it's line number starting
      in column one, followed by the text for the new  line.  To  delete  a
      line, just enter it's line number, with no following text.
   
         When a line is entered, (and return is pressed), it is copied into
      a buffer. Parts or all of this old line can  be  included  in  a  new
      line, as it is typed in. When the new line is entered,it then becomes
      the old line. A pointer is kept, indicating the current  position  in
      the old line. The following functions are available to  perform  this
      'editing'.
   
      CTRL-A
   
         Advance: Copy one character from the old line into the  new  line,
      and advance the pointer to the next character in the old line.
   
      CTRL-C
   
         Cancel: Cancels the (partially) complete  new  line,  and  restart
      from the beginning. (resets old line pointer).
   
      CTRL-D
   
         Delete: Advances the old line pointer by  one  character,deleteing
      that character from the old line. the new line is not affected. A '*'
      character is printed to indicate this has been done.
   
      CTRL-F
   
         Find: This command requires one extra  character  to  be  entered.
      When it is,  the  old  line  is  copied  (from  the  current  pointer
      position) into the new line,  up  to  but  NOT  including  the  first
      occurance of that character. The pointer is advanced to point to  the
      character found. If the character is not found, no action is taken.If
      the second character is a carriage return,the remainder  of  the  old
      line will be copied into the new line.
   
      CTRL-H
   
         Backup: This backs up one character,deleteing the  last  character
      entered, and backs up the old line pointer  in  the  old  line.  This
      effectively cancels the effect of the last  character  entered.  (The
      DELETE key also invokes this function).
   
      CTRL-M
   
         Carriage Return: enters the new line, causing  it  to  become  the
      (new) old line, and passes it to the interpreter, as input.
   MICRO BASIC USERS GUIDE                                          Page: 11


      CTRL-I
   
         Insert: Toggles insert mode. a "<" is printed when entering insert
      mode a ">" is printed when leaving insert mode.  Normally,  when  you
      enter text into the new line, the old line pointer  is  advanced,  so
      that the characters you are typing, effectivly replace the characters
      in the old line. In insert mode, this does not happen, therefore  the
      characters you are typing, can be inserted into the old line. (If  it
      is later copied into the new line).
   
         The line editor can be used to EDIT program  lines,  When  a  list
      command is executed, the last line listed will be made the old  line.
      To modify line 50, you would just have to type 'LIST 50'. This  would
      display line 50, and would also store it  in  the  old  line  buffer.
      Whenever a  program  stops  due  to  an  error,  CTRL-C,  or  a  STOP
      statement, the line it stopped on will also be stored in the old line
      buffer, ready for editing.

   5. CONTROL CHARACTERS
   
         The following control characters (other than the  ones  recognised
      by the line editor) are recognised. All other control characters, are
      ignored by the interpreter.
   
      CTRL-C
   
         Will abort any program, terminated with the message "STOP IN  LINE
      XXXX" where XXXX is the number of the line containing  the  statement
      which would have been executed next.  Will  also  abort  program,  if
      entered when responding to an INPUT statement, but will not print the
      "STOP" message. Will also abort output from the LIST command.
   
      CTRL-J (line feed)
   
         Will stop terminal output and/or program execution, for as long as
      the key is held down. When  released,  output/execution  will  resume
      normally.
   
      CTRL-N (SI)
   
         This character, will be ignored when entered  from  the  keyboard,
      but when printed, will  cause  the  eighth  bit  to  be  set  in  all
      subsequent characters which  are  printed.  Depending  on  the  video
      display used,  this  will  cause  REVERSE  VIDEO,  FLASHING,  DIM  or
      BRIGHTER output, GRAPHICS CHARACTERS, or  will  have  NO  EFFECT  (If
      display ignores extra bit).
   
      CTRL-O (SO)
   
         This character, will be ignored when entered  from  the  keyboard,
      but when printed, will cause the eighth bit  to  be  cleared  in  all
      characters which are subsequently printed. This will  restore  normal
      operation if a special  effect  was  invoked  via  the  CNTRL-N  (SI)
      control character above. For example, if  your  video  display  gives
      reverse video when the eighth bit  is  set,then  you  could  use  the
      following statement to print "REVERSE" in reverse video:
   
                      ' PRINT @[14]$,"REVERSE",@[15]$ '
   
      CTRL-L (FF)
   
         No effect from keyboard, Clears the screen and  homes  the  cursor
      when printed. Eg: ' PRINT @[12]$ '
   
      CTRL-K (VT)
   
         No effect from keyboard, Homes the  cursor  when  printed.  Eg:  '
      PRINT @[11]$ '

   6. ERROR MESSAGES
   
         Below is a list of error messages  produced  by  the  interpreter.
      Errors occuring in a program, will be followed by  "  IN  LINE  XXXX"
      where XXXX is the line on which the error was discovered. All  errors
      except '?BAD DATA - RETRY' are fatal,  and  will  stop  an  executing
      program.
   
      ?SYNTAX ERROR
   
         Results from a statement that is not decodeable. (Does not  follow
      syntax) Also results if you attempt to use a  command  in  the  wrong
      context. Ie. You use a  command  from  the  keyboard  which  is  only
      allowed from within a program.
   
      ?NO PROGRAM ERROR
   
         Results from an attempt to RUN or to SAVE an zero line program.
   
      ?DIMENSION ERROR
   
         Results from an  attempt  to  index  a  non-array  variable,  from
      indexing a character variable  with  a  value  greater  than  34,  or
      attempt to PLOT outside the screen.
   
      ?DIVIDE BY ZERO ERROR
   
         Results from attempt to divide any value by zero.
   
      ?LINE NUMBER ERROR
   
         Results from reference to a program  line  number  that  does  not
      exist.
   
      ?DATA ERROR
   
         Results from attempt to ORDER to a line which does not start  with
      a DATA statement, attempt to READ before you have executed an  ORDER,
      reading beyond the end of a DATA BLOCK, or  from  reading  the  wrong
      data type (character or numeric) for the operand variable.
   
      ?NESTING ERROR
   
         Results from improper nesting of GOSUB/RETURN or FOR/NEXT loops.
   
      ?BAD DATA - RETRY
   
         Results from any error  in  a  numeric  expression  typed  as  the
      response to an INPUT to  a  numeric  variable.  Does  not  stop,  but
      prompts again.
   
      ?I/O ERROR
   
         Indicates that a error has occured in the tape system,  Check  for
      bad tape.

   7. SOURCE FORMAT
   
         Micro Basic programs are stored  in  memory,  as  variable  length
      records, separated by carriage return character (0D hex). The end  of
      the program is marked by a  line  starting  with  a  hexidecimal  FF.
      Program lines are in the following format:
   
         -------------------------------------------------
         |2 bytes|1 byte| variable length section |1 byte|
         -------------------------------------------------

   8. EXAMPLE PROGRAMS
   
         The  following  are  some  simple  Micro  Basic  programs,   which
      demonstrate many of the features of the language. A good excercise to
      gain experience with the interpreter, is to enter and run  them,  and
      observe the results.

     0020 PRINT "I WILL PICK A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100"
     0030 PRINT "THEN I WANT YOU TO TRY AND GUESS IT."

   9. THE MICRO BASIC MONITOR
   
         The MICRO BASIC roms include a  machine  language  MONITOR,  which
      allows you to read/write memory, load and dump memory to tape, etc.
   
         The monitor has its own set of commands,  which  can  be  entered,
      whenever the system is RESET, or  when  ever  BASIC  is  exited  (via
      EXIT). Operands to commands are read (and executed) as  soon  as  you
      type them in (no carriage return is needed). Hexidecimal  BYTE  (<b>)
      values must be entered as TWO characters  (eg  5F),  and  WORD  (<w>)
      values must be entered using four characters (eg 00A5).
   
         A summary of commands followes:
   
     B                 Enters the BASIC interpreter,  initializing program,
                       variables, and arrays.
   
     D                 Downloads Intel hex format through the terminal port.
   
     G <w1>            Go, Begins execution at address <w1>
   
     L                 Loads from tape, indicates record count when  done
                       (in hex).
   
     M <w1>,<w2>       Displays MEMORY from <w1>, to <w2>.
   
     R                 Reenters BASIC, preserving existing program. Should
                       not be used when the system is first turned on.
   
     S <w1> XX-<b2>    Substitutes into memory, starting at address <w1> ,
                       Displays contents as XX, entering <b2> will replace
                       XX and advance to the next. Entering a  space  will
                       skip to the next, without changeing, and a carriage-
                       return will exit to monitor.
   
     T <H> or <F>      Enters terminal mode. Simulates an  ASCII  terminal
                       Operating in either <Full> or <Half> duplex. Serial
                       port is tape port.
   
     U <w>             Initalizes the 8251 usart with the value <w>.  See
                       INTEL 8251 documentation.
     W <w1>,<w2>       Writes memory from <w1> to <w2> to tape.

            The MONITOR keeps a byte of data which defines how I/O will  be
         handled. It is  located  at  address  $14FF  (5375),  and  can  be
         modified by the basic interpreter (or machine  language  program).
         It is as followes:
   
         Bits in I/O configuration byte.
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
         | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |    (Initial value is 00000011)
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   +--- 0 = Read from Uart.
           |   |   |   |   |   |   |        1 = Read from Keyboard.
           |   |   |   |   |   |   +------- 1 = Output to Video Display.
           |   |   |   |   |   +----------- 1 = Output to Uart. (8251)
           |   |   |   |   +--------------- 1 = Output to User Supplied
           |   |   |   |                        Output Device (See Below).
           |   |   |   +------------------- 0 = Translate input to upper case.
           |   |   |                        1 = Disable UPPER CASE translation.
           |   |   +----------------------- 1 = Disable CONTROL-C interrupts.
           |   +--------------------------- 1 = Inhibit all output.
           +------------------------------- 1 = Set Bit 7 in all characters
                                                output to Video Display.
   
            For example, to prevent a CONTROL-C stop from the keyboard, you
         could use the following statement:
   
                           ' @[5375]=@[5375]|20# '
   
            To reenable CNTRL-C stops, you would use:
   
                           ' @[5375]=@[5375]&DF# '.
   
      9.2 USER SUPPLIED OUTPUT DEVICE
   
            The system normally supports  two  output  devices,  the  VIDEO
         DISPLAY, and the 8251 UART. In addition, it supports  one  logical
         output device, to be defined by the user. This is useful for doing
         translations before you output a character as well.  To  use  this
         feature, you must supply a machine language output routine in  ram
         (somewhere outside  the  range  used  by  the  interpreter,  basic
         program, and any arrays). Then, store the address of  the  routine
         in the USER DEVICE VECTOR, which is located at addresses 14FD  and
         14FE (5373-5374), the low order address byte must  go  first.  The
         logical user output device is now defined, and can be  enabled  by
         setting bit 3 of the  I/O  config.  byte.  NOTE1:  Output  may  be
         directed to more than one device at once. NOTE2: If bit#3  of  the
         I/O config. byte is set to  1,  before  you  initialize  the  USER
         DEVICE VECTOR, Your computer will probably  crash  (And  you  will
         lose any unsaved programs).
   
            When the user routine is called, the character to be printed is
         passed in the B-REG, and I/O config. byte is passed in recister C.
         All of the processor registers may be modified by the subroutine.

      9.3 8251 USART
   
            The 8251 usart, is initialized to 1 stop bit, 7 data  bits,  no
         parity, and baud rate of 1/16 times  the  rx  and  tx  clocks.  To
         indicate when a tape operation is currently under way, the DSR pin
         of the 8251 will be set HIGH (+5v), and  LOW  (0v)  at  all  other
         times. A short delay is produced from the time this pin goes high,
         and a write to tape operation occures. This allows it to  be  used
         as a start/stop control for the tape machine, allowing the tape to
         get up to speed.
   
   10. SYSTEM MEMORY MAP
   
         The memory is used by the interpreter as follows:
   
        ADDRESS-RANGE             DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS.
   
          0000-0FFF   (4k)        Micro Basic Roms.
          1000-13FF   (1k)        Memory Mapped Video Display.
          1400-14FC   (253 Bytes) Input buffer, Machine stack, Internal storege.
          14FD-14FE   (2 Bytes)   User Device Vector.
          14FF        (1 Byte)    I/O Configuration byte.
          1500-15FF   (256 Bytes) Edit Buffer, Control stack, Internal storage.
          1600-19FF   (1k)        Fixed integer and character variables, flags.
          1A00-FFFF   (Any size)  Program and Array storage.
   
         When not using the Basic Interpreter (Executing  machine  language
      programs from the monitor), Any memory starting at 1500 or higher can
      be used without affecting the system. NOTE: Any time  you  enter  the
      basic interpreter, anything stored from 1500 to  1CFF  may  be  lost,
      Even if you do not enter any program text when in Basic.
