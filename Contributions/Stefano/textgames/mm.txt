   Usage:  mm [ -B ] [ -K ] [ -C# ] [ -P# ]
 
   where:  -B  tells # of possible solutions before each guess
	   -C# sets number of different characters (e.g., "-c4" means A-D)
		(defaults to 6)
	   -P# sets number of positions in solution string
		(defaults to 4)
	   -K  disables kibitzing (enabled by default.). 
		
    Thus, for example, the invokation
	   mm -C10 -P3
    would simulate the game of "Bagels", where the layout is ten different
    characters in three positions. I don't think "Bagels" allows repetitions,
    though, so it isn't QUITE the same...
