
V6Z80Pv1.1b prototype 3D-printed case prototype design by Phil Ruston 2012. 


Production Notes:
-----------------

There are three elements to the case design: 

1. The case top section
2. The case bottom section
3. A 90 degree power switch adapter

(Two lightpipes were created for v1.00 - these were not particularly
effective, off-the-shelf 3mm LED replacement lightpipes can be used
if need  be).

Do not use shiny surface finish - heat process warps the case.




V1.00 - Design was OK, if a little flimsy. The tabs are not very strong
        and the Status LED hold is misaligned.


v1.01 - Attempted to fix main problems with v1.00, but has not yet been
        manufactured.
