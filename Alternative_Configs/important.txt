IMPORTANT!
----------

Please make sure you use files from the correct folder as the
FPGA config files are not compatible between PCBs.

* Files in the "V6Z80P" folder are for the original V6Z80P PCB (made 
  prior to August 2010, marked "V6Z80P Rev 1.1", (8 pin mini DIN socket
  for video)

* Files in the "V6Z80P_plus" folder are for the V6Z80P+ V1.0 PCB
  (made between August 2010 and Dec 2010, PCB is marked
  "V6Z80P+ Rev1.0", and has a 15pin standard VGA socket)

* Files in the "V6Z80P_plus_v.1" folder are for the V6Z80P+ V1.1
  which allows alternative clock inputs (and FPGA control of the CPU
  clock) Normally the OSC SEL switch is in the DOWN POSITION. 
  Note: The V6Z80P+ v1.1 PCB can also use the config files for the
  V6Z80P+ v1.0 PCB AS LONG AS THE OSC SWITCH IS IN THE UP POSITION.


If developing new V6Z80P configs:

Take note of the pin connections of the peripherals/components on the
PCB (see pin list in docs) and avoid conflicting outputs. In general,
set your project's configuration options to pull all I/O pins not
used in your project high.
