Thank you for using the Z80 Scheme for Programmer's Notepad.

---- Installation ----

First of all, you need Programmer's Notepad (this is for PN, not
Notepad++, Notepad2, or any other text editor for coders).
You can download it from http://www.pnotepad.org/download/
(any version works fine). Install it wherever you want.

Wherever you install it, go to that directory. (By default it
should have installed at C:\Program Files\Programmer's Notepad\;
you may need administrator permissions for the following steps.)
Go into the folder called "schemes" and copy z80.scheme there.

Next time you start up Programmer's Notepad, you should see
"Z80 Assembler" listed as a language for syntax highlighting.

Note added by Phil: I found that Programmer's Notepad v2.3.4 didn't
notice the Z80 .scheme when i first copied it to its schemes dir.
I pasted in another "copy of" and it then it appeared in the
schemes list. Strange..
