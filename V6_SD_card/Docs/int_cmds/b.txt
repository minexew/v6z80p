
B - Bank select 

Pages in one of the fifteen 32KB
sysRAM banks at Z80 address space
$8000-$FFFF

Usage: B n 

Where n = 0 to E

EG:

"Bank 0" pages in sysRAM $08000-$0FFFF
"Bank 1" pages in sysRAM $10000-$17FFF
"Bank 2" pages in sysRAM $18000-$1FFFF

Notes:
	
FLOS does not allow sysRAM $0-$07fff
to be paged into $8000-$ffff (though
this can be achieved with direct
writes to the ports.)
