
FIRMWARE.EXE - Writes to EEPROM "wholesale"

Use: FIRMWARE file.bin [start_block]

If the start_block is not specified it'll
start writing from EEPROM block 0.

USE WITH CARE!
---------------

This app write data from a file to the
EEPROM with 64KB granularity. It should
be compatible will all versions of FLOS.
But if possible, use EEPROM.EXE in
preference as its safer and more elegant.
