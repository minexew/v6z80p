
EMU.EXE - Emulator config launcher

(Replaces GOSPEC.EXE)

Currently used to start Alessandro's
cycle perfect Spectrum emulators.
(A simple "BOOT n" is not sufficient
as files such as the Spectrum ROM
need to be pre-loaded into the
V6Z80P's memory).

Use: EMU (no parameters)

Notes:

The settings (slots used, currently
selected emulator) are saved in a
file called emu.cfg in a root folder
named SETTINGS (both are created if
necessary).
