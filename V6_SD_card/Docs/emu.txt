
EMU.EXE - Emulator config launcher

(Replaces GOSPEC.EXE)

Currently used to start Alessandro's
cycle perfect Spectrum emulators.
(A simple "BOOT n" is not sufficient
as files such as the Spectrum ROM
need to be pre-loaded into the
V6Z80P's memory).

Use: EMU (no parameters)

Notes:

The settings (slots used, currently
selected emulator) are saved in a
file called emu.cfg in a root folder
named SETTINGS (both are created if
necessary).

From version v0.04, EMU.EXE detects
status of expansion pin EXT_B. If
this is low (pulled down by a jumper)
Option 3 will restore from ESXDOS.NVR
If the pin is high (no jumper) 
RESIDOS.NVR is used. For this
automatic feature to work a) OSCA 
v671 must be installed and b) the
Spectrum emulator configs must be
versions 048K2715.bin / 128K2715.bin
or above.
