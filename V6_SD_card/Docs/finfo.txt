
FINFO.EXE - Retuns file length /
load address, sets the Envar "FSIZ"

Use: FINFO (#) filename

If # is included, the operation is
carried out silently (any FLOS
error message is also muted to $80)

Filename can contain path string.

A load and bank address is only
shown if the file is a program with
the location header.
