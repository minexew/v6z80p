
CHFNT.EXE - Changes the OS font

Use: CHFNT fontfile

Chfnt looks in the current directory
and then in the root/fonts directory
for the font file.

FONT FILE DESCRIPTION:

Fonts are 768 byte single-bitplane
bitmap files, dimensions:
96 bytes x 8 lines, covering the
definitions for ASCII characters
32-127. The chfnt command converts
the data into the format required
by the FLOS character plotting
system and the data is stored in
video RAM.

(There is space internally for 32
additional user-defined characters
(printable via non-standard ASCII
codes 128-159), though currently
the font must be patched using
the kernal call KJT_PATCH_FONT
if these characters are to be used.)
