
BULKFILE.FLX - Collates all files in dir

Use: BULKFILE filename

The resulting file contains a header
followed by all the files from the
source directory joined end-to-end.

The header is a file index. Each entry
is 16 bytes long. The header is
terminated with a zero:

Header Format:

First entry (not a file)
------------------------
$00       : $FF 
$01 - $0C : 0
$0D       : Length of header (ab,cd,ef)

Other entries (file indices)
----------------------------
$00 - $0B : Filename
$0C       : 0
$0D - $0F : Length of file (ab,cd,ef)

Termination:
------------
$00: 0

Collated files can be used with the
bulk_load routine in the code library
to replace long directory with a
single .dat file. Optionally, the
collated file could be attached to
end of an .exe, reducing everything
to a single file (the program load
truncation header should be employed
in this case).
