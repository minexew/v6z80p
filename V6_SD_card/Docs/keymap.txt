file. The currently available keymap
list is:

KEYMAP FILE DESCRIPTION:

Keymap files are "PS/2 set 2"
scancode-to-ASCII translation tables.
They can contain two or three "banks"
of the translation table: one for
unshifted keys, one for shifted keys
and optionally one for Alt-modified
keys. Each bank is 98 bytes long,
covering scancodes $00-$61
