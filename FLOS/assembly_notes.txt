
FLOS can be assembled from the text editor via
Pasmo like any other program. The resulting binary
file needs to have the header populated with the
PC program "Insert_CRC_into_OS.exe" found in
the "apps" dir. The creates the .OSF file
which can be loaded by the bootcode.

Note:

_MAKE_OS_VARIABLES.BAT must be run before assembly
if the the file "FLOS_VARIABLES.ASM" has been changed.
(This creates a file called "OS_variables.symbol")
