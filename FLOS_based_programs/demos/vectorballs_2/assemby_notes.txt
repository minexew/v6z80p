
With this demo, I removed the need for the demo to load in external
files when it runs - all the data is in one file which FLOS loads
into subsequent upper system RAM banks..

IE: The FLOS data load address goes..

    $5000 - FFFF bank 0
    $8000 - FFFF bank 1
    $8000 - FFFF bank 2
 
    etc..

However, as Pasmo cannot assemble beyond 64KB, the final executable binary
has to be made manually by joining three files (democode+music_player+samples)
to each other (use join.bat)

(The demo relocates the music data and samples to audio RAM on boot)
