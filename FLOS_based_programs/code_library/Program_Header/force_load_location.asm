; Demonstrates the file header that forces FLOS to load a program to
; an arbitary location (instread of $5000) - also shows how to test
; that the program is in the correct location.

;======================================================================================
; Program Location File Header:
; FLOS v568+ will use this data to load the program a specific location
; Earlier versions of FLOS will ignore it and load the program to $5000
;======================================================================================

my_location	equ $f000
my_bank		equ $0e


	org my_location	; desired load address
	
load_loc	db $ed,$00	; header ID (Invalid Z80 instruction)
	jr exec_addr	; jump over remaining header data
	dw load_loc	; location file should load to
	db my_bank	; upper bank the file should load to
	db 0		; dont truncate the program load

; Location Check:
; As an earlier version of FLOS may have loaded the program, or it has
; simply been loaded into memory somwhere as a binary file we can check to
; see if it is in the desired location before the main code attempts to run.
