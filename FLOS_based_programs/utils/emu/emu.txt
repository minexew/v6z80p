
EMU.EXE - Emulator Launcher v0.08

Used to start Alessandro's cycle
perfect Spectrum emulators.

Use: EMU (options)

If supplied, Options can be:

"M0" (IE: Machine 0 Spectrum 48)
"M1" (IE: Machine 1 Spectrum 128)
"M2" (IE: Machine 2 Pentagon 128)

(When arguments are supplied, you
can only boot into an alterate OS
from an .nvr file.)

Notes:

If the program has not been run
before you will be prompted to set
the config slot for each emulator
that is to be used.

The settings (slots used, currently
selected emulator) are saved in a
file called emu.cfg in a root folder
named SETTINGS (both are created if
necessary).

Emulators can use the status of
the expansion pin EXT_B to determine
hardware configuration (EG: The
Spectrum 48/128 emulators select
virtual hardware expansion devices
(zxMMC, divIDE etc) depending on
this pins. EMU also reads the pin
status to load an OS appropriate for
the hardware.

For the Spectrum 48/128 emulators:

If this pin is low (pulled down by a
fitted jumper) the system restores
to ESXDOS - If the pin is high (no
jumper) RESIDOS is used.

For this automatic feature to work

a) OSCA v671+ must be installed and

b) the Spectrum emulator configs must
be versions 048K2715.bin/128K2715.bin
or above.
